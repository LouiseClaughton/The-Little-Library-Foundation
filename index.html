                            <p id="story-text">The Little Library Foundation was founded when a young child spent months in hospital, suffering from an illness that the doctors said she would never 
                             recover from. She found solace only from the books her nurses brought her to read. The little girl spent every waking hour reading, diving 
                             head first into stories and folktales. She connected to the characters in the books, and imagined a better world, where every child suffering had countless 
                             worlds to call home. <br><br>
                             Over a decade later, that little girl outlived the doctor’s expectations, and she still loves books just as much as she did when she was stuck in that 
                             hospital bed. She now spends her days sat at bedsides, reading to sick children.
